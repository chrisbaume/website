Radio production is a creative pursuit that uses sound to inform, educate and entertain an audience. Radio producers
use audio editing tools to visually select, re-arrange and assemble sound recordings into programmes. However, current
tools represent audio using waveform visualizations that display limited information about the sound. Semantic audio
analysis can be used to extract useful information from audio recordings, including when people are speaking and what
they are saying. This thesis investigates how such information can be applied to create semantic audio tools that
improve the radio production process.
