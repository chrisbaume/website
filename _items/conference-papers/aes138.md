Audio editing is performed at scale in the production of radio, but often the tools used are poorly targeted toward the
task at hand. There are a number of audio analysis techniques that have the potential to aid radio producers, but
without a detailed understanding of their process and requirements, it can be difficult to apply these methods. To aid
this understanding, a study of radio production practice was conducted on three varied case studiesâ€”a news bulletin,
drama, and documentary. It examined the audio/metadata workflow, the roles and motivations of the producers, and
environmental factors. The study found that producers prefer to interact with higher-level representations of audio
content like transcripts and enjoy working on paper. The study also identified opportunities to improve the work flow
with tools that link audio to text, highlight repetitions, compare takes, and segment speakers.
