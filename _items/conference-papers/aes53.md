Music emotion recognition typically attempts to map audio features from music to a mood representation using machine
learning techniques. In addition to having a good dataset, the key to a successful system is choosing the right inputs
and outputs. Often, the inputs are based on a set of audio features extracted from a single software library, which may
not be the most suitable combination. This paper describes how 47 different types of audio features were evaluated
using a five-dimensional support vector regressor, trained and tested on production music, in order to find the
combination which produces the best performance. The results show the minimum number of features that yield optimum
performance, and which combinations are strongest for mood prediction.
