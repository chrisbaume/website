As the world's biggest broadcaster, the BBC transmits over 400 hours of audio content every day â€“ the vast majority of
which is in stereo. This paper will look at why the BBC is interested in Ambisonics, and describe recent experiences in
trying out the technology in its first-order format. Two subjective listening tests are described, which attempt to
discover how Ambisonics compares to current technology, and how much the height dimension contributes towards the
listening experience. Finally, some suggestions are made on how to make Ambisonics more accessible, in the hope that
more Ambisonic content would be created as a result.
