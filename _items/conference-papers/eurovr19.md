Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) consists of adding spatial audio entities into the real environment. Existing mobile applications and technologies open questions around interactive and collaborative AAR. This paper proposes an experiment to examine how spatial audio can prompt and support actions in interactive AAR experiences; how distinct auditory information influence collaborative tasks and group dynamics; and how gamified AAR can enhance participatory storytelling. We are developing an interactive multiplayer experience in AAR using the Bose Frames Audio Sunglasses. Four participants at a time will go through a gamified story that attempts to interfere with group dynamics. We here present our AAR platform and our collaborative game in terms of experience design. Finally, we detail the testing methodology and analysis that we will conduct to answer our research questions and to suggest methodologies for participatory storytelling in AAR.
