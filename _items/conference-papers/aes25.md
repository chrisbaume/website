A system, Vambu Sound, was developed for BBC R&D to create a spatial audio production environment.  The specification
of the system is to provide good localisation around a main television screen and diffuse sound from around the
listener. The developed system uses Vector Base Amplitude Panning for six loudspeakers in front of the listener and
Ambisonics for eight loudspeakers in the corners of a cube configuration. The system is made four-dimensional by the
incorporation of a dedicated haptic feedback channel within the audio format. The system design and implementation are
presented and responses from a demonstration are evaluated.
