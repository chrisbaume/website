This paper considers Ambisonics from a broadcaster's point of view: to identify barriers preventing its adoption within
the broadcast industry and explore the potential advantages were it to be adopted. This paper considers Ambisonics as a
potential production and broadcast technology and attempts to assess the impact that the adoption of Ambisonics might
have on both production workflows and the audience experience. This is done using two case studies: a large-scale music
production of "The Last Night of the Proms" and a smaller scale radio drama production of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz".
These examples are then used for two subjective listening tests: the first to assess the benefit of representing height
allowed by Ambisonics and the second to compare the audience’s enjoyment of first order Ambisonics to stereo and 5.0
mixes.
