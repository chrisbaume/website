Podcast players make poor use of the capabilities of the screen-based devices people use to listen. We present a podcast playback interface that displays charts, links, topics and contributors on an interactive transcript-based interface. We describe how we used paper prototyping to design the interface and what we learnt by doing so. We share preliminary results from a public online evaluation of the interface, which indicate that it was well-received. The new features were considered interesting, informative and useful, with charts and transcripts emerging as the most popular features.
