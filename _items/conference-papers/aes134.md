Classification of music by mood is a growing area of research with interesting applications, including navigation of
large music collections. Mood classifiers are usually based on acoustic features extracted from the music, but often
they are used without knowing which ones are most effective. This paper describes how 63 acoustic features were
evaluated using 2,389 music tracks to determine their individual usefulness in mood classification, before using
feature selection algorithms to find the optimum combination.
