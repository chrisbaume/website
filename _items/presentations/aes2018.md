Object-based audio is a revolutionary approach to broadcasting that enables the production and delivery of immersive,
interactive and accessible listening experiences. Chris will start by presenting an overview of the opportunities and
challenges of object-based audio. He will describe how BBC R&D designed and built an experimental radio studio and an
end-to-end object-based broadcast chain. Finally, he will discuss how the studio was used to deliver the worldâ€™s first
live interactive object-based radio drama, as part of the Orpheus collaborative project.
