Object-based audio is a revolutionary new way of broadcasting that unlocks a range of new audience experiences. In his
talk, Chris will explain how it works, discuss why it matters and present a number of public-facing experiments the BBC
have run. He will also take you behind-the-scenes on a next-generation radio studio the BBC are building to be able to
deliver these new experiences.
