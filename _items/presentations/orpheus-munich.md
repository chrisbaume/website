The Mermaid's Tears is an immersive and interactive radio drama created by the BBC as part of Orpheus. Listeners can
follow one of three characters and switch between them during the programme, which gives three different perspectives
on the same story. Listeners can also experience the drama in stereo, surround sound and binaural. Chris will describe
how the BBC produced the drama as a live object-based broadcast, the tools they developed in order to achieve this, and
the feedback they received from a large-scale public trial.
