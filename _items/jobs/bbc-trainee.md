As part of a two-year graduate scheme, I did four placements around the BBC. I worked with IBM to investigate
software-oriented architecture within back-end radio systems, used CUDA to create a real-time objective video quality
assessment system for HD video, experimented with Ambisonics as a method for recording and broadcasting spatial audio,
and wrote a strategic report for BBC Radio on audio codecs for contribution feeds.
