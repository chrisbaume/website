The move toward IP end-to-end between media producers and audiences will make the new broadcasting system vastly more
agnostic to data formats and a diverse set of consumption and production devices. In this world, object-based media
becomes increasingly important, i.e., delivering efficiencies in the production chain, enabling the creation of new
experiences that will continue to engage the audience, and giving us the ability to adapt our media to new platforms,
services, and devices. This paper describes a series of practical case studies of our work in object-based user
experiences since 2014. These projects encompass speech audio, online news, and enhanced drama. In each case, we are
working with production teams to develop systems, tools, and algorithms for an object-based world—these technologies
and techniques enable its creation (often using traditional linear media assets) and post-production—and transforming
user experience for audiences and production.
