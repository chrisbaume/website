The radio production workflow typically involves recording material, selecting which parts of that material to use, and
then editing the desired material down to the final output. Some radio producers find this process easier with paper
rather than editing directly on a screen, which makes a transcript the common denominator. However, after deciding
which audio they want to use, producers then must use a digital audio workstation to manually execute those editorial
decisions, which is a tedious and slow process. In this paper, the authors describe the design, development, and
evaluation of PaperClip, a novel system for editing speech recordings directly on a printed transcript using a digital
pen. A user study with eight professional radio producers compared editing with the digital pen to editing with a
screen interface. The two interfaces each had advantages and disadvantages. The pen interface was better for fast and
simple editing of familiar audio when accurate transcripts were available. The screen interface was better for more
complex editing with less familiar audio and less accurate transcripts. There was no overall preference.
