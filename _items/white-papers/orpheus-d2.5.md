This document is based upon the previous D2.3 Interim Pilot Progress Report. It describes the final status of both
phases of the ORPHEUS pilot. The first phase was divided into three stages, with the first being a live production of
an interactive object-based radio drama experienced using a web browser, the second a selection of material encoded
using MPEG-H and made available through an iPhone and AV receiver, and the third being an ‘as-live’ broadcast, live
encoded using MPEG-H and made available over the Internet. In the second phase object-based audio productions from
pilot phase 1 were enhanced with interactive functionalities for on-demand consumption.
