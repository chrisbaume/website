The deliverable D2.1 provides an overview about the current state of the pilot implementation architecture and its
influence on the final reference architecture. The reference architecture will be developed during the project time,
based on experiences from the project pilots. A detailed explanation regarding the distinction between reference
architecture and pilots is included. The planned workflow of the pilots is described as well as the current state of
macroblocks and their components. This document will be updated twice during the project.
