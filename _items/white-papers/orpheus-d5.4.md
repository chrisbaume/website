Two different user interfaces have been created to explore personalisation of, and interaction with, object-based
broadcasts. An app on an iPhone demonstrates personalisation by enabling the listener to change the balance between
different elements of a programme, or to have the sound adapted automatically to one of several pre-defined listening
environments. The app also allows the user to choose a shorter or longer version of a programme, to jump to points of
interest, and to see transcripts. The web browser interface developed for The Mermaid's Tears drama allows the listener
to choose between parallel narrative threads, supporting the story-telling with images. The choice of stereo, binaural,
or surround sound reproduction is also offered.
