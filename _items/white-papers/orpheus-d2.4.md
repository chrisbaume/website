This document describes the final reference architecture of ORPHEUS, a completely object-based, end-to-end broadcast
and production workflow. It has been the subject of intensive discussions and several iterations over the duration of
the project and has been shaped by considering typical channel-based broadcast workflows as well as the knowledge
gained and lessons learned from the pilot phases. The architecture is format and interface agnostic and, as far as is
possible, it should be applicable to a range of different infrastructures and ecosystems. Additionally, the pilot
implementation and integration is also summarised.
