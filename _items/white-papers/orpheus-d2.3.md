This document describes the current status of Orpheus pilot phase 1, which has been divided into three stages. The
first stage is a live production of an interactive object-based radio drama that can be experienced using a web
browser. The second is a selection of material encoded using MPEG-H and made available through an iPhone and AV
receiver. The third is an 'as-live' broadcast, live encoded using MPEG-H and made available over the Internet.
