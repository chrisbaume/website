This document aims to identify the main technical and end-user requirements for the reception, presentation and
personalised consumption of broadcast object-based content. Its purpose is to serve as guidelines for the design,
implementation and assessment of technical solutions that will be developed during the project. Usability
specifications are exemplified through various mock-ups and user scenarios. Several hardware and software solutions are
considered for the end-user device in order to cover different audio content consumption situations (e.g. domestic use
vs mobility). Personalisation and interactivity features are also listed and will require the design and development of
user interfaces handling various input devices (e.g. touch screen, GPS sensors, microphone).
