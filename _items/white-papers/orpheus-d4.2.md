This deliverable describes the progress on representation, archiving and provision of object-based audio. It builds on
D4.1 "Requirements for representation, archiving and provision of object-based audio". It lists the formats which are
selected for ORPHEUS and describes the interim status of the implementation of these formats. On the production side,
formats like BW64, ADM, NMOS, UMCP are used and explained. BW64 is also used for archiving. For provision or
distribution MPEG-H and AAC + ADM metadata are selected. Both solutions use MPEG-DASH for streaming.
This Deliverables also serves as documentation for milestone MS12 "Initial implementation and documentation of a format
for provision of objected-based audio" which has been achieved on 31/03/17.
