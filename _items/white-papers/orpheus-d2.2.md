Deliverable D2.2 provides an overview about the current state of the pilot implementation architecture and its
influence on the final reference architecture. Moreover, the integration activities so far are summarised. The
reference architecture will be developed during the project time, based on experiences from the project pilots. A
detailed explanation regarding the distinction between reference architecture and pilots is included. The planned
workflow of the pilots is described as well as the current state of macroblocks and their components. This version of
D2.2 includes updates, which were requested by the EC reviewer after the first submission. Hence, interfaces were
identified and where necessary, described in more detail. This document will be updated once more during the project.
