I am a Lead Research Engineer at BBC Research and Development, where I co-lead the Audio Team. I'm interested in how technology can be used to unlock people's creative potential. My research focuses on the efficient production of personalised, immersive, and accessible audio experiences through the application of DSP, machine learning, and user-centred design techniques. I manage the BBC Audio Research Partnership which, over the past decade, has sponsored over thirty students and launched ten collaborative projects worth Â£30M. I'm co-investigator on the AI for Future Personalised Media Experiences (AI4ME) partnership, where I lead the research on production tools. I also recently led the production tools work stream of the EU project ORPHEUS on object-based audio. I earned my PhD at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) at the University of Surrey.
